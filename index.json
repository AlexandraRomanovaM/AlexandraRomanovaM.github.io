The study focused on options and futures traded on the Moscow Exchange. In the process of writing my final qualifying work, I investigated mathematical models for evaluating the value of options, which are currently used by all financial analysts. With the help of the investigated methods, the option values were calculated and the corresponding forecasts for the future were given. The main conclusions are made, the results are summed up.","tags":[],"title":" Mathematical methods for evaluating derivatives","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Romanova Alexandra"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1608563657,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608563657,"objectID":"d5732ddbcb7c2ad28a21d614f5eabce0","permalink":"/project/my_personal_project/","publishdate":"2020-12-21T18:14:17+03:00","relpermalink":"/project/my_personal_project/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"My_personal_project","type":"project"},{"authors":["Romanova Alexandra","Golos Elizaveta","Konyukhov Roman","Popkova Elena"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1608563633,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608563633,"objectID":"5795843355dcdd763c40a36ad0fef74e","permalink":"/project/my_group_project/","publishdate":"2020-12-21T18:13:53+03:00","relpermalink":"/project/my_group_project/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"My_group_project","type":"project"}]
